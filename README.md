# Search Engines and Web Navigation Coursework 1; Search Engine Optimisation

A very basic website forming part of the coursework for the Birkbeck College DCSIS SEWN assignment one. The aim is to design,
create, and publish a website that is likely to be ranked highly in search engine results pages for specific
queries. It should also contain some dynamic content. I have chosen to aggregate two RSS feeds for the dynamic content
to produce the Tech News.
